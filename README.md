# Encryption

##Goals

This is a personal project to learn more about encryption. I don't ensure anything is cryptographically secure (it most likely isn't), but hopefully you can learn something from it.

## Sub projects
### OTR Chat

This is a project to learn more about Off the Record chat. It should provide forward secrecy and deniable authentication, which should allow users to encrypt their messages and deny they sent it.

### Maths

There isn't any code currently in here, but the project is to learn more about generating primes, a key component of encryption. I will likely use these for future encryption projects.
